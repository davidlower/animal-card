# animal-card
A portfolio card for an animal - first project on Udacity Nano-degree.
The card hard restrictions that I had to follow. 

- italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
- bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
- no dots for the animal's list items
- border around the animal's name, image, and information
- border around the animal's information
- spacing between the animal's name, image, and information.
